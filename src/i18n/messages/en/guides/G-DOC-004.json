  "legalBasis": "EU Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure compliance with food law; EU Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on food hygiene; Real Decreto 640/2006 on hygiene conditions for food preparation and sale; Ley 17/2011 de seguridad alimentaria y nutrición",
  "summary": "Health inspections are official controls conducted by competent authorities to verify compliance with food safety regulations. In Spain, these inspections are carried out by inspectors from the autonomous community health departments (typically Sanidad or Salud Pública), and they can occur at any time without prior notice. Food business operators must be prepared for inspection at all times, which means maintaining food safety documentation, ensuring premises and practices meet hygiene standards, and having designated staff who can assist inspectors professionally and knowledgeably.\n\nThe inspection process typically involves a comprehensive review of HACCP documentation and records, physical inspection of premises including storage areas, preparation zones, and equipment, observation of food handling practices and staff hygiene, temperature checks of refrigeration, freezing, and hot holding equipment, examination of food products for labeling, date marking, and condition, review of supplier documentation and traceability systems, checking cleaning and pest control records, and verification that all food handlers possess valid certificates. Inspectors use standardized checklists and scoring systems, with findings categorized by severity from minor observations to critical non-conformities that may trigger enforcement action.\n\nPreparation for health inspection is not a one-time activity but an ongoing commitment to maintaining compliance. This includes daily monitoring and record-keeping, regular internal audits to identify and correct issues before inspectors find them, ensuring all staff understand their responsibilities and can answer basic questions about procedures, maintaining documentation in an organized and readily accessible manner, and keeping premises, equipment, and practices consistently at inspection-ready standards. A proactive approach to food safety compliance ensures that routine inspections proceed smoothly, builds a positive relationship with health authorities, and most importantly, protects customers from foodborne illness and the business from enforcement action, reputational damage, and financial penalties.",

      "heading": "1. Understanding the Health Inspection Process",
      "content": "Official food safety inspections in Spain are governed by EU Regulation 882/2004, which establishes a harmonized framework for official controls throughout the European Union. Inspections are risk-based, meaning that establishments handling high-risk products or with a history of non-compliance are inspected more frequently than low-risk businesses with good compliance records. For typical hospitality establishments, inspection frequency ranges from annually for well-performing businesses to quarterly or more for those with compliance issues.\n\nInspections are generally unannounced to ensure that inspectors observe normal operating practices rather than special preparations. Upon arrival, the inspector will identify themselves and present official credentials. The inspection typically begins with a review of documentation (HACCP plan, monitoring records, certificates) while simultaneously or subsequently conducting a physical inspection of the premises and observation of food handling practices. The inspector will ask questions of staff and management to assess knowledge and understanding of food safety procedures.\n\nAt the conclusion of the inspection, the inspector will discuss preliminary findings with the manager or person in charge. A formal inspection report is typically provided or sent within days, categorizing findings by severity: observations (minor issues not requiring immediate action), non-conformities (deficiencies that must be corrected, with deadlines), and critical non-conformities (serious food safety hazards requiring immediate corrective action). The report will specify required corrective actions and deadlines, and follow-up inspections may be scheduled to verify compliance.",

          "heading": "1.1 Inspector Rights and Powers",
          "content": "Health inspectors have extensive legal powers to enter and inspect food business premises without notice during operating hours or at other reasonable times. They may examine any food products, equipment, or documentation, take samples for laboratory analysis, photograph or video record premises and practices, interview staff, and in cases of serious non-compliance, seize products or equipment and order immediate closure. Food business operators must provide access and cooperation.\n\nObstructing an inspection or providing false information is a serious offense that can result in significant penalties. However, inspectors also have obligations to conduct inspections professionally, minimize disruption to business operations where possible, maintain confidentiality of business information, and provide clear explanation of findings and required actions."

          "heading": "1.2 Inspection Criteria and Scoring",
          "content": "Most autonomous communities use standardized inspection checklists based on EU and national requirements, often with numerical scoring systems. Common frameworks include assessment of HACCP implementation (hazard analysis documented, CCPs identified and monitored, records maintained), structural and equipment conditions (adequate facilities, good repair, appropriate design for food safety), cleaning and disinfection (plan documented, records current, visible cleanliness), temperature control (refrigeration, freezing, cooking, hot holding within legal limits), pest control (contracted service, records available, no evidence of infestation), staff hygiene and training (valid certificates, appropriate clothing, correct practices), and traceability and supplier control (documented suppliers, delivery records, lot identification).\n\nEstablishments typically receive a numerical score or categorization (e.g., favorable, acceptable, deficient, very deficient). Some regions publicly display inspection results or ratings at the establishment entrance or online. Poor scores or categorizations can trigger more frequent inspections, enforcement action, and reputational damage."

          "heading": "1.3 Consequences of Non-Compliance",
          "content": "The consequences of inspection findings depend on the nature and severity of non-conformities. Minor observations may require corrective action but typically do not trigger formal enforcement. Non-conformities usually result in an improvement notice specifying required actions and deadlines, with follow-up inspection to verify compliance. Failure to comply with improvement notices can result in financial penalties.\n\nCritical non-conformities that present imminent risk to public health can trigger immediate enforcement action: prohibition orders preventing use of specific equipment or areas, product withdrawal or destruction orders, temporary closure until hazards are corrected, and in cases of serious or repeated violations, sanctions under Ley 17/2011 ranging from fines of €5,001 to €600,000 depending on severity, permanent closure, and potential criminal prosecution in cases of gross negligence or intentional violations. Beyond legal penalties, failed inspections can cause severe reputational damage, loss of customer trust, negative publicity, and declining business."

Inspectors will review the HACCP documentation in detail to verify that it is comprehensive, current, and actually implemented in practice. The HACCP plan must identify all food safety hazards relevant to the establishment's operations, determine Critical Control Points (CCPs) for controlling those hazards, establish critical limits for each CCP, define monitoring procedures, specify corrective actions for deviations, and establish verification and record-keeping procedures.\n\nDocumentation must be site-specific and reflect actual operations, not generic templates. The plan should be dated and signed by the person responsible, with evidence of annual review and updates following any significant changes to operations, equipment, or products. Inspectors will check whether the HACCP team is identified and whether at least one member has appropriate training. Most importantly, inspectors will compare the documented plan with actual practices and records to verify implementation.",

Records must demonstrate daily monitoring of refrigerator temperatures (target 0-4°C, maximum 5°C), freezer temperatures (minimum -18°C), hot holding temperatures (minimum 63°C), and cooking temperatures for high-risk foods (minimum 75°C core temperature). Records should also document delivery temperatures for chilled and frozen goods.\n\nInspectors will verify that temperature records are current (up to and including the day of inspection), complete (no missing dates or unexplained gaps), accurate (spot-checking against actual temperatures during inspection), and show appropriate corrective actions when temperatures exceeded limits. Missing records, falsified entries, or systematic failures to maintain required temperatures are serious non-conformities.

The plan should specify what is cleaned, how (method and products), when (frequency), and by whom (responsible person). Cleaning records must demonstrate that the plan is followed in practice, with daily checklists signed by the person who performed each task.\n\nInspectors will compare cleaning records with actual observed cleanliness. Discrepancies—such as signed records claiming areas were cleaned when visible dirt or grease is present—indicate either non-compliance or falsification. Food-safe cleaning products should be identifiable, properly stored (separated from food), and used at correct dilutions. Safety Data Sheets for all cleaning chemicals should be available."

Establishments must be able to identify suppliers for all food products and demonstrate one-step-back, one-step-forward traceability. This requires maintaining supplier details including name, address, and health registration number, delivery notes with dates, lot numbers, and product descriptions, and records linking delivered products to their use or sale. Records must be retained for a minimum period (typically five years).\n\nInspectors may select specific products and trace them back to the supplier or forward to service/sale. Inability to provide this information is a non-conformity. Inspectors also verify that suppliers are approved and registered food businesses. Purchasing food from unauthorized or unregistered suppliers is a serious violation."

Adequate handwashing facilities with hot and cold running water, soap, and hand drying facilities must be conveniently located and used.\n\nCooking equipment must be adequate for the operations performed and maintained in good working order. Ventilation hoods over cooking equipment must be properly sized, functioning effectively, and kept clean (particularly filters, which should show evidence of regular cleaning).

Staff must wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water before handling food, after handling raw food, after using the toilet, after touching hair or face, after handling waste, and after any activity that could contaminate hands. Inspectors will observe whether handwashing facilities are used appropriately and whether staff demonstrate correct handwashing technique (minimum 20 seconds, attention to fingernails and between fingers)."
