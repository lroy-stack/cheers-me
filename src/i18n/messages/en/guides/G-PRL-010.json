  "legalBasis": "Royal Decree 486/1997 on minimum workplace health and safety requirements; Ley 31/1995 de Prevenci\u00f3n de Riesgos Laborales; NTP 322 (INSST) on thermal environment assessment",
  "summary": "Thermal stress is one of the most significant occupational hazards in hospitality environments, particularly in kitchens where workers are routinely exposed to extreme heat from ovens, grills, fryers, and stovetops. Royal Decree 486/1997 establishes the minimum conditions for workplace temperature, humidity, and ventilation that employers must maintain to protect worker health and safety.\n\nThis guide covers both heat stress and cold stress scenarios relevant to hospitality operations, including kitchen heat exposure, cold storage work, and outdoor terrace service during extreme weather. It provides practical strategies for assessment, prevention, and emergency response in line with Spanish occupational health regulations.\n\nUnderstanding thermal stress prevention is essential for hospitality managers and workers alike, as prolonged exposure to thermal extremes can lead to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, hypothermia, and chronic health conditions. Spanish law requires employers to conduct specific risk assessments for thermal hazards and implement appropriate control measures.",

          "content": "Article 7 and Annex III of RD 486/1997 establish specific temperature ranges for different types of work. For sedentary work (such as office administration in a restaurant), temperatures must be maintained between 17\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. For light physical work (such as table service), the range is 14\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. These limits apply to enclosed workspaces where environmental conditions can be controlled. The regulation also requires that temperature differentials between adjacent workspaces not exceed certain thresholds to prevent thermal shock when workers move between areas."

Relative humidity must be maintained between 30% and 70%, except where there is a risk of static electricity, in which case the minimum rises to 50%. Kitchens require enhanced mechanical ventilation systems including extraction hoods above all heat-generating equipment."

This includes conducting risk assessments (Art. 16), providing information and training (Art. 18-19), health surveillance (Art. 22), and consulting with workers' representatives. Workers have the right to refuse work in conditions of serious and imminent danger (Art. 21) and cannot be disciplined for doing so."

      "content": "Kitchens are the highest-risk area for heat stress in any hospitality operation. Ambient temperatures near cooking stations can exceed 40\u00b0C during peak service, compounding the metabolic heat generated by intense physical activity. Proper assessment and control of heat stress requires understanding both environmental and personal factors.",

          "heading": "2.1 WBGT Index Assessment",
          "content": "The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index is the standard method for assessing heat stress exposure in workplaces, as recommended by the INSST (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo) in their technical guidance NTP 322. The WBGT combines air temperature, humidity, radiant heat, and air movement into a single index. For moderate work intensity typical of kitchen operations, the reference WBGT limit is 26\u00b0C. Measurements should be taken at the workstation level during peak cooking periods. When WBGT values exceed reference limits, employers must implement control measures or restrict exposure time using work-rest cycles."

Effective measures include: installing high-capacity extraction hoods with make-up air systems that supply cooled fresh air; positioning air curtains between kitchen and service areas; using radiant heat shields near grills and ovens; selecting energy-efficient equipment that generates less waste heat; maintaining adequate spacing between heat-generating appliances; and installing spot cooling systems directed at worker stations. Air conditioning in kitchen environments must be designed to avoid creating uncomfortable drafts while maintaining effective cooling."

          "heading": "2.3 Work Organization and Hydration",
          "content": "Administrative controls are essential complements to engineering measures. These include implementing rotation schedules so no single worker is continuously exposed to the hottest stations; scheduling the most heat-intensive preparation tasks (such as large-batch cooking) during cooler periods; establishing mandatory rest breaks in cool areas during extended service periods; providing unlimited access to cool drinking water (employers must supply at least 250 ml per worker per hour during hot conditions); and allowing self-pacing of work where possible. New workers should undergo a heat acclimatization program of 7-14 days with gradually increasing exposure."

Spanish regulations require that workers entering these spaces have appropriate insulated clothing, including thermal gloves, and that exposure times be limited. For freezer work at -18\u00b0C, continuous exposure should not exceed 60 minutes without a warming break. Cold rooms must have interior door release mechanisms and alarm systems as a safety requirement. Workers should never enter cold storage alone, and a buddy system or regular check-in protocol must be established."

During summer heat waves, when ambient temperatures exceed 35\u00b0C, employers must provide shade structures, additional hydration, and modified schedules. During winter, outdoor workers need appropriate cold-weather clothing and access to heated break areas. Municipal regulations in many Spanish cities now require terrace heating or cooling systems for customer comfort, but employers must ensure these also benefit workers. The employer's risk assessment must specifically address seasonal outdoor working conditions."

These rapid transitions can cause thermal shock and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Prevention measures include establishing transition zones with intermediate temperatures, allowing brief acclimatization pauses when moving between extreme environments, and ensuring that work uniforms can be easily layered for thermal adaptability."

In kitchens, monitoring should be conducted during peak service periods when thermal loads are highest. Measurement equipment must be calibrated and records maintained. Digital temperature and humidity loggers placed at key workstations provide ongoing data for risk assessment. Results should be reviewed monthly and after any changes to equipment layout, ventilation systems, or work processes."

This includes pre-employment medical evaluations to identify workers with conditions that increase vulnerability to thermal stress (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, certain medications), periodic health checks during employment, and return-to-work assessments after heat-related illness. Health surveillance must be conducted by the servicio de prevenci\u00f3n and results are confidential.
